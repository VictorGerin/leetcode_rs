# 3606. Coupon Code Validator

## Descrição

You are given three arrays of length `n` that describe the properties of `n` coupons: `code`, `businessLine`, and `isActive`. The `i`-th coupon has:

- `code[i]`: a string representing the coupon identifier.
- `businessLine[i]`: a string denoting the business category of the coupon.
- `isActive[i]`: a boolean indicating whether the coupon is currently active.

A coupon is considered valid if all of the following conditions hold:

1. `code[i]` is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (`_`).
2. `businessLine[i]` is one of the following four categories: `"electronics"`, `"grocery"`, `"pharmacy"`, `"restaurant"`.
3. `isActive[i]` is `true`.

Return an array of the `codes` of all valid coupons, sorted first by their `businessLine` in the order: `"electronics"`, `"grocery"`, `"pharmacy"`, `"restaurant"`, and then by `code` in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.
